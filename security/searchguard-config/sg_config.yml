# This is the main configuration file where the authentication and authorization
# backends as well as the http authenticators and other settings will be defined.
#
# The authentication works like that:
# 
# If there are no authenticators (authc) defined a implicit one will be created.
# This will authenticate against the internal user database and use HTTP Basic.
#
# If more than one is configured the first one which succeeds wins. If all fail then the request will be unauthenticated
# and a respective exception is thrown and/or the HTTP status is set to 401.
# 
# After authentication authorization (authz) will be applied. There can be zero or more authorizers which collect
# the roles from a given backend for the authenticated user.
#
# For HTTP is possible to allow anonymous authentication. If that is allowed then the http authenticators try to
# find user credentials in the HTTP request and if such where found then the user gets regularly authenticated.
# If none can be found the user will be authenticated as an "anonymous" user. This user has always the username "sg_anonymous"
# and one role named "sg_anonymous_backendrole". If you enable anonymous authentication for all http authenticators will not challenge.
# 
#
# Notice: If you define more than one authenticator make sure to put non-challenging authenticators like "proxy" or "clientcert"
# at the beginning and the challenging one at the end. If you configure more than one challenging authenticator you have to deal with
# the "challenge" flag. Because its not possible to challenge a client with two different authentication methods (for example
# Kerberos and Basic) only one can have challenge: true. All others need to have challenge: false and that means
# they look into the request and if they found no credentials they will not challenge. You can cope with this situation
# with pre-authentication. That is submitting credentials for non-challenging authenticators within the first request
# (Thats especially easy for Basic authentication). 
# Default value of the challenge flag is true.
